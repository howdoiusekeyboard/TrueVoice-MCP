# Contributing to TrueVoice MCP

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is simple by design, and we want to keep it that way.

## Quick Start

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Test locally: `npm start` or `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js`

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Run linting
npx ultracite check

# Auto-fix issues
npx ultracite fix

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test HTTP endpoint locally
vercel dev
```

## What to Contribute

### Welcome

- Bug fixes
- Additional slop patterns and phrases
- Improved detection algorithms
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Test cases

### Please Avoid

- Complex features that break simplicity
- Heavy dependencies
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Over-engineering

## Code Guidelines

### Style

- Run `npx ultracite fix` before committing
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use TypeScript types properly

### Anti-Slop Rules

When adding new slop patterns to `src/rules.ts`:

- Base patterns on research or common observations
- Provide concrete examples
- Include both the pattern to avoid and the better alternative
- Keep explanations concise

### Testing Changes

Test your changes with:

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Test stdio transport (Claude Desktop)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js

# Test HTTP transport (web clients)
vercel dev
# Then visit http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
```
